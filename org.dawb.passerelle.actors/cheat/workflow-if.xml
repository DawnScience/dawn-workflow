      <description>
         We will start with the finished example file which processes contains an 'If' with two branches.
         Under the 'File' main menu choose 'Close All' to close all the data file parts being shown. Then click below to open this tutorial file.

      <description>
		 Before starting to use the if actor please consult its documentation.

      <subitem
            label="1. Right-click on the actor called 'If' and choose 'Help'. You will see the Eclipse help system open up the documentation for the if actor.">

      <subitem
            label="2. Read the documentation in order to become familiar with the if actor.">

         title="How 'If' Works">
      <description>
         There is only one new actor in this tutorial - the 'If'. The test works by having many branches from one actor. You can create as many connections from an If actor to other actors, you must then create expressions which test values for each connection (they evaluate to 'true' by default). This is done by clicking the button on the 'Expressions' attribute of the 'Actor Attributes' part.
      </description>
      <subitem
            label="1. Select the actor called 'If'. Go to the 'Actor Attributes' part and open the editor for the parameter 'Expressions' by using the button labelled '...' when you click in the 'Value' column.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="2. You will see a popup form which shows the expressions for each branch of the output of the if. If you add new connections, these appear automatically in the 'Expressions' editor.">

         title="Run the Workflow">
      <description>
         Find the green play button in the application main toolbar and run this workflow. It will run and open the error message. Fix this by setting the 'Scalar Value' attribute of 'Scalar' to 1. Run the workflow again and go to the tree of the hdf5 viewer when it is shown by the 'Open File' actor. Expand the 'Dictionary' node and view the scalar values and names/times of operations completed. Here you can find the time at which the operation was competed.

         title="Add a Branch">
      <description>
         In this step we will simply add another branch and complete its expression.
      </description>
      <subitem
            label="1. Click and drag another 'Message' actor to the workflow, make it an INFORMATION message and fill in parameters indicating that a value of three or greater is ignored.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="2. Edit the 'Expressions' attribute of 'If'. Change the expression value of the 'output' port (connected to the 'Warning' message dialog) to be x==2, add a new output port with a name and an expression parameter set to 'x&gt;=3' ">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="3. Connect the new output of 'If' to the new message actor's white 'input' port.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="4. Experiment running the workflow with different x values until you are happy how the 'If' actor works.">
      </subitem>
    <onCompletion>
      Congratulations, you can now test values and complete conditional branches in the workflow.
