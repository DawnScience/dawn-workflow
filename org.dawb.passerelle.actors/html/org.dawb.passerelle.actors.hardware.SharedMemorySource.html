<H2>Shared Memory Source 
</H2>
<P>This source monitors shared memory and whenever it changes (note
it doe nothing when no change occurs), it fires the pipeline with the
data read. By default the actor monitors until stopped, i.e. the
workflow never stops unless a stop actor is used downstream. There is
an expert parameter to specify a timeout if the data does not change
for a given time. The monitor can deal with 1D and 2D data being
stored in the shared memory. For 1D there is a chunk size to specify
the number of 1D arrays to read from the stack of shared memory.
Integer and floating point data is supported. The actor uses a Tango
client so the correct tango server for reading spec shared memory
should be installed.</P>
