<H2>Spec  Command</H2>
<P>This actor sends spec commands into spec. These can either be
individual commands, the result of each of which is recorded in a
variable and passed on or a single macro file, which does not record
output other than in the log file. All commands sent to spec are
wrapped in an eval('  ') statement which means they can be typed in
to the user interface the same as if entering commands directly into
spec. If using the macro file option, you can right click on the
actor and open an substitution editor for the maco. This allows
upstream variables to be inserted to the macro by highlighting and
double clicking the variable on the left. This actor requires tango
servers to work and requires the correct tango client settings under
'Window-&gt;Prefrences-&gt;Data Analysis-&gt;Tango'.</P>
