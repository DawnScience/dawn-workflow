<H2>Tango Motor  
</H2>
<P>This actor is a transformer type meaning it receives and transmits
messages but does not create messages or act as a sink. The actor
attaches to a Tango server which provides an attribute for setting
value of hardware and reading value. In fact the Tango attribute does
not have to move a motor, it can result in any action when the
attribute changes. 
</P>
<P>To set up the Tango connection go to Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Data
Analysis-&gt;Tango. The system will attempt to automatically set the
correct properties on a beamline by reading the environment variables
when it starts for the first time. You will likely need to set the
spec session name however.</P>
<P>The 'Motors' attribute in the actor optionally sets the motors and
always reads their value, passing this downstream in the pipeline.
Typically the 'Motor Name' will be the URL to the TangoDevice after
the beamline name. Something like 'motors/phi' normally. Currently
the connection is not generic, only exposed motors in tango can be
connected to - not everything. However arbitrary spec commands can be
sent with the 'Spec Command' transformer.</P>
