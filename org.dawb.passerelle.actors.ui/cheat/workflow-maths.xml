	<intro>
		<description>
		    In this tutorial we will look at completing a simple maths algorithm to do basic operations on matrices. If you are familiar with numpy, you may wish to go to the python tutorial instead. However there is still a lot to learn by completing this tutorial.

         Please choose the workflow perspective if you do not already have it selected (nothing will happen if you do not).

      <description>
         We will start with the finished example file which does basic maths operations on two images, placing the results in a hdf5 (or nexus) file. Don't forget that your project must be called 'workflows' for the file to open automatically.

         title="Understanding the Workflow">
      <description>
         We start by selecting a few actors and explaining what they do.
      </description>
      <subitem
            label="1. Select 'ref-testscale_1_001'. This is an actor reading the file 'ref-testscale_1_001.img' and passing it's two dimensional array of data on to the following nodes. Notice that its connections to the following nodes are highlighted when you select on the actor. Right click on the actor and choose the first option to open the file and view it.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="2. Click on 'Subtract', notice that it has two inputs 'a' and 'b'. The operation done by this actor is 'a-b'. Look at the attributes of Subtract in the 'Actor Attributes' view. The parameter 'Expression Mode' is useful when subtracting many files, as is seen in a later example.">
      </subitem>
       <subitem
            label="3. Click on the 'Data Export' actor. This actor writes a nexus compliant hdf5 file.">
      </subitem>
       <subitem
            label="4. Click on the 'Open File' actor. This actor will open the hdf5 file written in a new part window when the workflow is run.">
      </subitem>
   </item>
    <item
         title="Run the Workflow">
      <description>
         Find the green play button in the application main toolbar and run this workflow. It will run and open the hdf5 file when completed. Now select the results of the various mathematical operations which you have just completed using the 'Data' view.

         title="Create it Yourself">
      <description>
         This workflow is a lot easier to create than you might imagine. Please follow these steps to create it by clicking and draging the various parts.

      <subitem
            label="1. Start a new workflow file by using the wizard under &apos;File-&gt;New-&gt;Other-&gt;Workflows-&gt;Workflow Model&apos; as seen in the previous tutorial.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="2. Click and drag the file 'data/ref-testscale_1_001.img' and 'data/ref-testscale_1_002.img' to the workflow diagram from the 'data' folder visible in the 'Project Explorer'.">
      </subitem>
       <subitem
            label="3. In the 'Pallette' view, under the maths actors click and drag over 'Add' 'Substract' 'Multiply' 'Divide' and 'Median'.">
      </subitem>
       <subitem
            label="4. Click and drag in a 'Data Export' actor. (NOTE there is a search box above the tree of actors to find things.)">
      </subitem>
       <subitem
            label="5. Click and drag in an 'Combiner' actor.">
      </subitem>
       <subitem
            label="6. Click and drag in an 'Open File' actor.">
      </subitem>
       <subitem
            label="7. Create connections between the actors as they were before (ref-testscale_1_001.img going to 'a' and ref-testscale_1_002.img going to 'b'). You can position the actors using the blue lining up lines which automatically appear when you click and move an actor, to get the connections to run nicely.">
      </subitem>
       <subitem
            label="8. The default values of the actor attributes are good enough for this example - hit run and run your version of the maths example!">
      </subitem>
       <subitem
            label="9. If your connections are still untidy, try using the actions by clicking on the blue button displaying one point and three wires (you should read 'Connection types' when you pass the mouse hover this button ). These give different connection and router options.">
      </subitem>
    <onCompletion>
      Congratulations, you can now complete simple maths in a workflow and visualize the results. Give it a try with some data from your experiment.
